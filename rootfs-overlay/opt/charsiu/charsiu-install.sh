#
# The rocket driver is mainline for RK3588. The commit adding
# `rockchip,rk3576-rknn-core` is ours, from 2026-08-06, and is not reachable
# from any tag. An earlier version of this script checked for a working NPU and
# stopped when it did not find one. That was every machine on earth, so the
# check was a dead end wearing a helpful expression. It now OFFERS A KERNEL:
# CI builds linux-next plus the v9 series and publishes it, and this fetches it.
#
# ⚠ AND IT KEEPS THE ONE ALREADY THERE. The new kernel becomes the default boot
# entry and the previous one stays on the card as a second entry, because a
# kernel that does not boot is not a thing to discover with no way back.
# ⚠⚠ THE WHOLE SCRIPT IS ONE BRACE GROUP, ON PURPOSE.
#
# `sh` reads a piped script in chunks and runs each one as it arrives. This
# script reattaches the terminal with `exec < /dev/tty`, which CLOSES the pipe
# curl is still writing into, and curl then dies with
#
#     curl: (23) Failure writing output to destination, passed 1378 returned 1311
#
# Measured, not theorised: that is what the first `curl ... | sh` run printed.
# A brace group has to be parsed to its closing brace before any of it runs, so
# the shell drains the whole stream first and curl finishes cleanly. It also
# means a truncated download runs nothing at all instead of half of something.
